Title: Alpha-9 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor immunoreactivity in the rodent vestibular labyrinth.
Journal: The Journal of comparative neurology
Publication Date: Nov, 2005
Abstract:
Vestibular tissues (cristae ampullares, macular otolithic organs, and Scarpa's ganglia) in chinchilla, rat, and guinea pig were examined for immunoreactivity to the alpha9 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunit. The alpha9 antibody was generated against a conserved peptide present in the intracellular loop of the predicted protein sequence of the guinea pig alpha9 nAChR subunit. In the vestibular periphery, staining was observed in calyces around type I hair cells, at the synaptic pole of type II hair cells, and in varying levels in Scarpa's ganglion cells. Ganglion cells were also triply labeled to detect alpha9, calretinin, and peripherin. Calretinin labels calyx-only afferents. Peripherin labels bouton-only afferents. Dimorphic afferents, which have both calyx and bouton endings, are not labeled by calretinin or peripherin. In these experiments, alpha9 was expressed in both calyx and dimorphic afferents. A subpopulation of small ganglion cells did not contain the alpha9 nAChR but did stain for peripherin. We surmise that these are bouton-only afferents. Bouton (regularly discharging) afferents also show efferent responses, although they are qualitatively different from those in irregularly discharging (calyx and dimorphic) afferents, much slower and longer lasting. Thus, regular afferents are probably more affected via a muscarinic cholinergic or a peptidergic mechanism, with a much smaller superimposed fast nicotinic-type response. This latter response could be due to one of the other nicotinic receptors that have been described in studies from other laboratories.

Title: Developmental regulation of nicotinic synapses on cochlear inner hair cells.
Journal: The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience
Publication Date: Sep, 2004
Abstract:
In the mature cochlea, inner hair cells (IHCs) transduce acoustic signals into receptor potentials, communicating to the brain by synaptic contacts with afferent fibers. Before the onset of hearing, a transient efferent innervation is found on IHCs, mediated by a nicotinic cholinergic receptor that may contain both alpha9 and alpha10 subunits. Calcium influx through that receptor activates calcium-dependent (SK2-containing) potassium channels. This inhibitory synapse is thought to disappear after the onset of hearing [after postnatal day 12 (P12)]. We documented this developmental transition using whole-cell recordings from IHCs in apical turns of the rat organ of Corti. Acetylcholine elicited ionic currents in 88-100% of IHCs between P3 and P14, but in only 1 of 11 IHCs at P16-P22. Potassium depolarization of efferent terminals caused IPSCs in 67% of IHCs at P3, in 100% at P7-P9, in 93% at P10-P12, but in only 40% at P13-P14 and in none of the IHCs tested between P16 and P22. Earlier work had shown by in situ hybridization that alpha9 mRNA is expressed in adult IHCs but that alpha10 mRNA disappears after the onset of hearing. In the present study, antibodies to alpha10 and to the associated calcium-dependent (SK2) potassium channel showed a similar developmental loss. The correlated expression of these gene products with functional innervation suggests that Alpha10 and SK2, but not Alpha9, are regulated by synaptic activity. Furthermore, this developmental knock-out of alpha10, but not alpha9, supports the hypothesis that functional nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in hair cells are heteromers containing both these subunits.

Title: Developmental mRNA expression of the alpha10 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit in the rat cochlea.
Journal: Brain research. Developmental brain research
Publication Date: Nov, 2002
Abstract:
A recently discovered alpha10 subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) family is believed to form a heteromeric receptor with the alpha9 nAChR subunit in auditory hair cells. In the present study, the alpha10 nAChR subunit expression in the developing and adult rat inner ear was analyzed by PCR and localized using isotopic in situ hybridization. Unlike the alpha9 subunit, the alpha10 subunit was not detected at embryonic day 18 (E18). From E21 through postnatal day 15 (P15), the alpha10 subunit was localized over both inner hair cell (IHC) and outer hair cell (OHC) regions, but in the mature cochlea detectable levels of alpha10 mRNA were found only over the OHC region. From E21 through adult ages, there was also a small but consistent basal to apical gradient of alpha10 expression; that is, higher levels in basal regions and lower levels in apical regions. Previously, we detected the alpha9 nAChR subunit over IHCs as early as E18 and throughout adult ages with a clear basal-apical gradient of expression. Our studies raise the question of whether the alpha9 and alpha10 subunits are differentially regulated during embryonic and postnatal development.

Title: Biophysical and pharmacological characterization of nicotinic cholinergic receptors in rat cochlear inner hair cells.
Journal: The Journal of physiology
Publication Date: Jul, 2005
Abstract:
Before the onset of hearing, a transient efferent innervation is found on inner hair cells (IHCs). This synapse is inhibitory and mediated by a nicotinic cholinergic receptor (nAChR) probably formed by the alpha9 and alpha10 subunits. We analysed the pharmacological and biophysical characteristics of the native nAChR using whole-cell recordings from IHCs in acutely excised apical turns of the rat organ of Corti. Nicotine did not activate but rather blocked the acetylcholine (ACh)-evoked currents with an IC50 of 1 +/- 0.1 microM. Antagonists of non-cholinergic receptors such as strychnine, bicuculline and ICS-205930 blocked ACh-evoked responses with an IC50 of 8.6 +/- 0.8 nM, 59 +/- 4 nM and 0.30 +/- 0.02 microM, respectively. The IHC nAChR was both permeable to (P(Ca)/P(Na) = 8 +/- 0.9) and modulated by external Ca2+. ACh-evoked currents were potentiated by Ca2+ up to 500 microM but were reduced by higher concentrations of this cation. Ba2+ mimicked the effects of Ca2+ whereas Mg2+ only blocked these currents. In addition, elevation of extracellular Ca2+ reduced the amplitude of spontaneous synaptic currents without affecting their time course. The receptor had an EC50 for ACh of 60.7 +/- 2.8 microM in 0.5 mM Ca2+. In the absence of Ca2+, the EC50 for ACh increased, suggesting that potentiation by Ca2+ involves changes in the apparent affinity for the agonist. These pharmacological and biophysical characteristics of the IHC nAChR closely resemble those of the recombinant alpha9alpha10 nAChR, reinforcing the hypothesis that the functional nAChR at the olivocochlear efferent-IHC synapse is composed of both the alpha9 and alpha10 subunits.
