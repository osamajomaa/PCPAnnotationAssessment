Title: Basic local alignment search tool.
Journal: Journal of molecular biology
Publication Date: Oct, 1990
Abstract:
A new approach to rapid sequence comparison, basic local alignment search tool (BLAST), directly approximates alignments that optimize a measure of local similarity, the maximal segment pair (MSP) score. Recent mathematical results on the stochastic properties of MSP scores allow an analysis of the performance of this method as well as the statistical significance of alignments it generates. The basic algorithm is simple and robust; it can be implemented in a number of ways and applied in a variety of contexts including straightforward DNA and protein sequence database searches, motif searches, gene identification searches, and in the analysis of multiple regions of similarity in long DNA sequences. In addition to its flexibility and tractability to mathematical analysis, BLAST is an order of magnitude faster than existing sequence comparison tools of comparable sensitivity.

Title: Neuronal specification in the spinal cord: inductive signals and transcriptional codes.
Journal: Nature reviews. Genetics
Publication Date: Oct, 2000
Abstract:
Neural circuits are assembled with remarkable precision during embryonic development, and the selectivity inherent in their formation helps to define the behavioural repertoire of the mature organism. In the vertebrate central nervous system, this developmental program begins with the differentiation of distinct classes of neurons from progenitor cells located at defined positions within the neural tube. The mechanisms that specify the identity of neural cells have been examined in many regions of the nervous system and reveal a high degree of conservation in the specification of cell fate by key signalling molecules.

Title: Crystallography & NMR system: A new software suite for macromolecular structure determination.
Journal: Acta crystallographica. Section D, Biological crystallography
Publication Date: Sep, 1998
Abstract:
A new software suite, called Crystallography & NMR System (CNS), has been developed for macromolecular structure determination by X-ray crystallography or solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. In contrast to existing structure-determination programs, the architecture of CNS is highly flexible, allowing for extension to other structure-determination methods, such as electron microscopy and solid-state NMR spectroscopy. CNS has a hierarchical structure: a high-level hypertext markup language (HTML) user interface, task-oriented user input files, module files, a symbolic structure-determination language (CNS language), and low-level source code. Each layer is accessible to the user. The novice user may just use the HTML interface, while the more advanced user may use any of the other layers. The source code will be distributed, thus source-code modification is possible. The CNS language is sufficiently powerful and flexible that many new algorithms can be easily implemented in the CNS language without changes to the source code. The CNS language allows the user to perform operations on data structures, such as structure factors, electron-density maps, and atomic properties. The power of the CNS language has been demonstrated by the implementation of a comprehensive set of crystallographic procedures for phasing, density modification and refinement. User-friendly task-oriented input files are available for nearly all aspects of macromolecular structure determination by X-ray crystallography and solution NMR.

Title: Pax6 controls progenitor cell identity and neuronal fate in response to graded Shh signaling.
Journal: Cell
Publication Date: Jul, 1997
Abstract:
Distinct classes of motor neurons and ventral interneurons are generated by the graded signaling activity of Sonic hedgehog (Shh). Shh controls neuronal fate by establishing different progenitor cell populations in the ventral neural tube that are defined by the expression of Pax6 and Nkx2.2. Pax6 establishes distinct ventral progenitor cell populations and controls the identity of motor neurons and ventral interneurons, mediating graded Shh signaling in the ventral spinal cord and hindbrain.

Title: Abnormal blood vessel development and lethality in embryos lacking a single VEGF allele.
Journal: Nature
Publication Date: Apr, 1996
Abstract:
The endothelial cell-specific vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its cellular receptors Flt-1 and Flk-1 have been implicated in the formation of the embryonic vasculature. This is suggested by their colocalized expression during embryogenesis and the impaired vessel formation in Flk-1 and Flt-1 deficient embryos. However, because Flt-1 also binds placental growth factor, a VEGF homologue, the precise role of VEGF was unknown. Here we report that formation of blood vessels was abnormal, but not abolished, in heterozygous VEGF-deficient (VEGF+/-) embryos, generated by aggregation of embryonic stem (ES) cells with tetraploid embryos (T-ES) and even more impaired in homozygous VEGF-deficient (VEGF-/-) T-ES embryos, resulting in death at mid-gestation. Similar phenotypes were observed in F1-VEGF+/- embryos, generated by germline transmission. We believe that this heterozygous lethal phenotype, which differs from the homozygous lethality in VEGF-receptor-deficient embryos, is unprecedented for a targeted autosomal gene inactivation, and is indicative of a tight dose-dependent regulation of embryonic vessel development by VEGF.

Title: Functional interaction of beta-catenin with the transcription factor LEF-1.
Journal: Nature
Publication Date: Aug, 1996
Abstract:
The cytoplasmic proteins beta-catenin of vertebrates and armadillo of Drosophila have two functions: they link the cadherin cell-adhesion molecules to the cytoskeleton, and they participate in the wnt/wingless signal pathway. Here we show, in a yeast two-hybrid screen, that the architectural transcription factor LEF-1 (for lymphoid enhancer-binding factor) interacts with beta-catenin. In mammalian cells, coexpressed LEF-1 and beta-catenin form a complex that is localized to the nucleus and can be detected by immunoprecipitation. Moreover, LEF-1 and beta-catenin form a ternary complex with DNA that splays an altered DNA bend. Microinjection of LEF-1 into XenoPus embryos induces axis duplication, which is augmented by interaction with beta-catenin. Thus beta-catenin regulates gene expression by direct interaction with transcription factors such as LEF-1, providing a molecular mechanism for the transmission of signals, from cell-adhesion components or wnt protein to the nucleus.

Title: 2.2 Mb of contiguous nucleotide sequence from chromosome III of C. elegans.
Journal: Nature
Publication Date: Mar, 1994
Abstract:
As part of our effort to sequence the 100-megabase (Mb) genome of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, we have completed the nucleotide sequence of a contiguous 2,181,032 base pairs in the central gene cluster of chromosome III. Analysis of the finished sequence has indicated an average density of about one gene per five kilobases; comparison with the public sequence databases reveals similarities to previously known genes for about one gene in three. In addition, the genomic sequence contains several intriguing features, including putative gene duplications and a variety of other repeats with potential evolutionary implications.

Title: Groucho-mediated transcriptional repression establishes progenitor cell pattern and neuronal fate in the ventral neural tube.
Journal: Cell
Publication Date: Mar, 2001
Abstract:
The pattern of neuronal specification in the ventral neural tube is controlled by homeodomain transcription factors expressed by neural progenitor cells, but no general logic has emerged to explain how these proteins determine neuronal fate. We show that most of these homeodomain proteins possess a conserved eh1 motif that mediates the recruitment of Gro/TLE corepressors. The eh1 motif underlies the function of these proteins as repressors during neural patterning in vivo. Inhibition of Gro/TLE-mediated repression in vivo results in a deregulation of cell pattern in the neural tube. These results imply that the pattern of neurogenesis in the neural tube is achieved through the spatially controlled repression of transcriptional repressors-a derepression strategy of neuronal fate specification.

Title: Dorsal differentiation of neural plate cells induced by BMP-mediated signals from epidermal ectoderm.
Journal: Cell
Publication Date: Sep, 1995
Abstract:
The cellular interactions that control the differentiation of dorsal cell types from neural progenitors have been examined in neural plate explants. Certain genes that are expressed in the dorsal neural tube are initially expressed uniformly within the neural plate and appear to achieve their dorsal restriction through a Sonic hedgehog (SHH)-mediated repressive signal from the notochord. The acquisition of definitive dorsal cell fates, however, requires a contact-dependent signal from the epidermal ectoderm. BMP4 and BMP7 are expressed in the epidermal ectoderm, and both proteins mimic its inductive activity. BMP4 and a related gene, DSL1, are subsequently expressed by cells in the dorsal neural tube. The differentiation of dorsal cell types, therefore, appears to be initiated at the neural plate stage and to involve the opponent activities of a BMP-mediated dorsalizing signal from the epidermal ectoderm and a SHH-mediated ventralizing signal from the notochord.

Title: Two critical periods of Sonic Hedgehog signaling required for the specification of motor neuron identity.
Journal: Cell
Publication Date: Nov, 1996
Abstract:
Antibodies that block Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signaling have been used to show that SHH activity is required for the induction of floor plate differentiation by the notochord and independently for the induction of motor neurons by both the notochord and midline neural cells. Motor neuron generation depends on two critical periods of SHH signaling: an early period during which naive neural plate cells are converted into ventralized progenitors and a late period that extends well into S phase of the final progenitor cell division, during which SHH drives the differentiation of ventralized progenitors into motor neurons. The ambient SHH concentration during the late period determines whether ventralized progenitors differentiate into motor neurons or interneurons, thus defining the pattern of neuronal cell types generated in the neural tube.

Title: Expression of a Delta homologue in prospective neurons in the chick.
Journal: Nature
Publication Date: Jun, 1995
Abstract:
The product of the Delta gene, acting as ligand, and that of the Notch gene, acting as receptor, are key components in a lateral-inhibition signalling pathway that regulates the detailed patterning of many different tissues in Drosophila. During neurogenesis in particular, neural precursors, by expressing Delta, inhibit neighbouring Notch-expressing cells from becoming committed to a neural fate. Vertebrates are known to have several Notch genes, but their functions are unclear and their ligands hitherto unidentified. Here we identify and describe a chick Delta homologue, C-Delta-1. We show that C-Delta-1 is expressed in prospective neurons during neurogenesis, as new cells are being born and their fates decided. Our data from the chick, combined with parallel evidence from Xenopus, suggest that both the Delta/Notch signalling mechanism and its role in neurogenesis have been conserved in vertebrates.

Title: RING fingers mediate ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2)-dependent ubiquitination.
Journal: Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America
Publication Date: Sep, 1999
Abstract:
A RING finger-containing protein (AO7) that binds ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2s) and is a substrate for E2-dependent ubiquitination was identified. Mutations of cation-coordinating residues within AO7's RING finger abolished ubiquitination, as did chelation of zinc. Several otherwise-unrelated RING finger proteins, including BRCA1, Siah-1, TRC8, NF-X1, kf-1, and Praja1, were assessed for their ability to facilitate E2-dependent ubiquitination. In all cases, ubiquitination was observed. The RING fingers were implicated directly in this activity through mutations of metal-coordinating residues or chelation of zinc. These findings suggest that a large number of RING finger-containing proteins, with otherwise diverse structures and functions, may play previously unappreciated roles in modulating protein levels via ubiquitination.

Title: Signal-dependent nuclear export of a histone deacetylase regulates muscle differentiation.
Journal: Nature
Publication Date: Nov, 2000
Abstract:
Members of the myocyte enhancer factor-2 (MEF2) family of transcription factors associate with myogenic basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors such as MyoD to activate skeletal myogenesis. MEF2 proteins also interact with the class II histone deacetylases HDAC4 and HDAC5, resulting in repression of MEF2-dependent genes. Execution of the muscle differentiation program requires release of MEF2 from repression by HDACs, which are expressed constitutively in myoblasts and myotubes. Here we show that HDAC5 shuttles from the nucleus to the cytoplasm when myoblasts are triggered to differentiate. Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK) signalling, which stimulates myogenesis and prevents formation of MEF2-HDAC complexes, also induces nuclear export of HDAC4 and HDAC5 by phosphorylation of these transcriptional repressors. An HDAC5 mutant lacking two CaMK phosphorylation sites is resistant to CaMK-mediated nuclear export and acts as a dominant inhibitor of skeletal myogenesis, whereas a cytoplasmic HDAC5 mutant is unable to block efficiently the muscle differentiation program. Our results highlight a mechanism for transcriptional regulation through signal- and differentiation-dependent nuclear export of a chromatin-remodelling enzyme, and suggest that nucleo-cytoplasmic trafficking of HDACs is involved in the control of cellular differentiation.

Title: Sonic hedgehog and Fgf-4 act through a signaling cascade and feedback loop to integrate growth and patterning of the developing limb bud.
Journal: Cell
Publication Date: Dec, 1994
Abstract:
Proper limb growth and patterning requires signals from the zone of polarizing activity in the posterior mesoderm and from the overlying apical ectodermal ridge (AER). Sonic hedgehog and Fgf-4, respectively, have recently been identified as candidates for these signals. We have dissected the roles of these secreted proteins in early limb development by ectopically regulating their activities in a number of surgical contexts. Our results indicate that Sonic hedgehog initiates expression of secondary signaling molecules, including Bmp-2 in the mesoderm and Fgf-4 in the ectoderm. The mesoderm requires ectodermally derived competence factors, which include Fgf-4, to activate target gene expression in response to Sonic hedgehog. The expression of Sonic hedgehog and Fgf-4 is coordinately regulated by a positive feedback loop operating between the posterior mesoderm and the overlying AER. Taken together, these data provide a basis for understanding the integration of growth and patterning in the developing limb.

Title: The CLUSTAL_X windows interface: flexible strategies for multiple sequence alignment aided by quality analysis tools.
Journal: Nucleic acids research
Publication Date: Dec, 1997
Abstract:
CLUSTAL X is a new windows interface for the widely-used progressive multiple sequence alignment program CLUSTAL W. The new system is easy to use, providing an integrated system for performing multiple sequence and profile alignments and analysing the results. CLUSTAL X displays the sequence alignment in a window on the screen. A versatile sequence colouring scheme allows the user to highlight conserved features in the alignment. Pull-down menus provide all the options required for traditional multiple sequence and profile alignment. New features include: the ability to cut-and-paste sequences to change the order of the alignment, selection of a subset of the sequences to be realigned, and selection of a sub-range of the alignment to be realigned and inserted back into the original alignment. Alignment quality analysis can be performed and low-scoring segments or exceptional residues can be highlighted. Quality analysis and realignment of selected residue ranges provide the user with a powerful tool to improve and refine difficult alignments and to trap errors in input sequences. CLUSTAL X has been compiled on SUN Solaris, IRIX5.3 on Silicon Graphics, Digital UNIX on DECstations, Microsoft Windows (32 bit) for PCs, Linux ELF for x86 PCs, and Macintosh PowerMac.

Title: The transcriptional coactivators p300 and CBP are histone acetyltransferases.
Journal: Cell
Publication Date: Nov, 1996
Abstract:
p300/CBP is a transcriptional adaptor that integrates signals from many sequence-specific activators via direct interactions. Various cellular and viral factors target p300/CBP to modulate transcription and/or cell cycle progression. One such factor, the cellular p300/CBP associated factor (PCAF), possesses intrinsic histone acetyltransferase activity. Here, we demonstrate that p300/CBP is not only a transcriptional adaptor but also a histone acetyltransferase. p300/CBP represents a novel class of acetyltransferases in that it does not have the conserved motif found among various other acetyltransferases. p300/CBP acetylates all four core histones in nucleosomes. These observations suggest that p300/CBP acetylates nucleosomes in concert with PCAF.

Title: BCL-2, BCL-X(L) sequester BH3 domain-only molecules preventing BAX- and BAK-mediated mitochondrial apoptosis.
Journal: Molecular cell
Publication Date: Sep, 2001
Abstract:
Critical issues in apoptosis include the importance of caspases versus organelle dysfunction, dominance of anti- versus proapoptotic BCL-2 members, and whether commitment occurs upstream or downstream of mitochondria. Here, we show cells deficient for the downstream effectors Apaf-1, Caspase-9, or Caspase-3 display only transient protection from "BH3 domain-only" molecules and die a caspase-independent death by mitochondrial dysfunction. Cells with an upstream defect, lacking "multidomain" BAX, BAK demonstrate long-term resistance to all BH3 domain-only members, including BAD, BIM, and NOXA. Comparison of wild-type versus mutant BCL-2, BCL-X(L) indicates these antiapoptotics sequester BH3 domain-only molecules in stable mitochondrial complexes, preventing the activation of BAX, BAK. Thus, in mammals, BH3 domain-only molecules activate multidomain proapoptotic members to trigger a mitochondrial pathway, which both releases cytochrome c to activate caspases and initiates caspase-independent mitochondrial dysfunction.

Title: Deleted in Colorectal Cancer (DCC) encodes a netrin receptor.
Journal: Cell
Publication Date: Oct, 1996
Abstract:
The guidance of developing axons in the nervous system is mediated partly by diffusible chemoattractants secreted by axonal target cells. Netrins are chemoattractants for commissural axons in the vertebrate spinal cord, but the mechanisms through which they produce their effects are unknown. We show that Deleted in Colorectal Cancer (DCC), a transmembrane protein of the immunoglobulin superfamily, is expressed on spinal commissural axons and possesses netrin-1-binding activity. Moreover, an antibody to DCC selectively blocks the netrin-1-dependent outgrowth of commissural axons in vitro. These results indicate that DCC is a receptor or a component of a receptor that mediates the effects of netrin-1 on commissural axons, and they complement genetic evidence for interactions between DCC and netrin homologs in C. elegans and Drosophila.

Title: Roles for FGF8 in the induction, initiation, and maintenance of chick limb development.
Journal: Cell
Publication Date: Jan, 1996
Abstract:
We provide evidence that FGF8 serves as an endogenous inducer of chick limb formation and that its expression in the intermediate mesoderm at the appropriate time and place to trigger forelimb development is directly linked to the mechanism of embryonic kidney differentiation. One function of the limb inducer is to initiate Fgf8 gene expression in the ectoderm overlying the prospective limb-forming territories. FGF8 secreted by the ectoderm then appears to initiate limb bud formation by promoting outgrowth of and Sonic hedgehog expression in the underlying lateral plate mesoderm. FGF8 also maintains mesoderm outgrowth and Sonic hedgehog expression in the established limb bud. Our data thus point to FGF8 as a key regulator of limb development that not only induces and initiates the formation of a limb bud, but also sustains its subsequent development.

Title: The CBP co-activator is a histone acetyltransferase.
Journal: Nature
Publication Date: , 
Abstract:
The CBP protein acts as a transcriptional adaptor for many different transcription factors by directly contacting DNA-bound activators. One mechanism by which CBP is thought to stimulate transcription is by recruiting the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) P/CAF to the promoter. Here we show that CBP has intrinsic HAT activity. The HAT domain of CBP is adjacent to the binding site for the transcriptional activator E1A. Although E1A displaces P/CAF from CBP, it does not disrupt the CBP-associated HAT activity. Thus E1A carries HAT activity when complexed with CBP. Targeting CBP-associated HAT activity to specific promoters may therefore be a mechanism by which E1A acts as a transcriptional activator.

Title: A role for neural determination genes in specifying the dorsoventral identity of telencephalic neurons.
Journal: Genes & development
Publication Date: Jan, 2000
Abstract:
Neurogenin1 (Ngn1), Neurogenin2 (Ngn2), and Mash1 encode bHLH transcription factors with neuronal determination functions. In the telencephalon, the Ngns and Mash1 are expressed at high levels in complementary dorsal and ventral domains, respectively. We found that Ngn function is required to maintain these two separate expression domains, as Mash1 expression is up-regulated in the dorsal telencephalon of Ngn mutant embryos. We have taken advantage of the replacement of the Ngns by Mash1 in dorsal progenitors to address the role of the neural determination genes in neuronal-type specification in the telencephalon. In Ngn2 single and Ngn1; Ngn2 double mutants, a population of early born cortical neurons lose expression of dorsal-specific markers and ectopically express a subset of ventral telencephalic-specific markers. Analysis of Mash1; Ngn2 double mutant embryos and of embryos carrying a Ngn2 to Mash1 replacement mutation demonstrated that ectopic expression of Mash1 is required and sufficient to confer these ventral characteristics to cortical neurons. Our results indicate that in addition to acting as neuronal determinants, Mash1 and Ngns play a role in the specification of dorsal-ventral neuronal identity, directly linking pathways of neurogenesis and regional patterning in the forebrain.

Title: The medial ganglionic eminence gives rise to a population of early neurons in the developing cerebral cortex.
Journal: The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience
Publication Date: Sep, 1999
Abstract:
During development of the neocortex, the marginal zone (layer I) and the subplate (layer VII) are the first layers to form from a primordial plexiform neoropil. The cortical plate (layers II-VI) is subsequently established between these superficial and deep components of the primordial plexiform neuropil. Neurons in the early zones are thought to play important roles in the formation of the cortex: the Cajal-Retzius cells of the marginal zone are instrumental in neuronal migration and laminar formation, and cells of the subplate are involved in the formation of cortical connections. Using the fluorescent tracer 1,1'-dioctodecyl-3,3,3', 3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine (DiI), we have shown here that a substantial proportion of neurons of the marginal zone, including cells with features of Cajal-Retzius cells, and of the subplate and lower intermediate zone are not born in the ventricular neuroepithelium but instead originate in the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE), the pallidal primordium. These neurons follow a tangential migratory route to their positions in the developing cortex. They express the neurotransmitter GABA but seem to lack the calcium binding protein calretinin; some migrating cells found in the marginal zone express reelin. In addition, migrating cells express the LIM-homeobox gene Lhx6, a characteristic marker of the MGE. It is suggested that this gene uniquely or in combination with other transcription factors may be involved in the decision of MGE cells to differentiate in situ or migrate to the neocortex.

Title: Sox10, a novel transcriptional modulator in glial cells.
Journal: The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience
Publication Date: Jan, 1998
Abstract:
Sox proteins are characterized by possession of a DNA-binding domain with similarity to the high-mobility group domain of the sex determining factor SRY. Here, we report on Sox10, a novel protein with predominant expression in glial cells of the nervous system. During development Sox10 first appeared in the forming neural crest and continued to be expressed as these cells contributed to the forming PNS and finally differentiated into Schwann cells. In the CNS, Sox10 transcripts were originally confined to glial precursors and later detected in oligodendrocytes of the adult brain. Functional studies failed to reveal autonomous transcriptional activity for Sox10. Instead, Sox10 functioned synergistically with the POU domain protein Tst-1/Oct6/SCIP with which it is coexpressed during certain stages of Schwann cell development. Synergy depended on binding to adjacent sites in target promoters, was mediated by the N-terminal regions of both proteins, and could not be observed between Sox10 and several other POU domain proteins. Interestingly, Sox10 also modulated the function of Pax3 and Krox-20, two other transcription factors involved in Schwann cell development. We propose a role for Sox10 in conferring cell specificity to the function of other transcription factors in developing and mature glia.

Title: A single protocol to detect transcripts of various types and expression levels in neural tissue and cultured cells: in situ hybridization using digoxigenin-labelled cRNA probes.
Journal: Histochemistry
Publication Date: Dec, 1993
Abstract:
We have developed a simple non-radioactive in situ hybridization procedure for tissue sections and cultured cells using digoxigenin-labelled cRNA probes. This protocol can be applied for the detection of various transcripts present at a wide range of expression levels in the central nervous system. Cerebellar hybridization signals for transcripts estimated to be expressed at high (MBP, myelin basic protein), moderate (GluR1, subunit of AMPA/kainate sensitive glutamate receptors) and low (inositol polyphosphate-5-phosphatase) levels of abundance are demonstrated as examples. The sensitivity and cellular resolution were significantly improved by avoiding any ethanol treatment commonly used in other procedures. The localization of a labelled cell with respect to its environment is shown to be more easily assessed by counterstaining of the tissue with the nuclear dye Hoechst 33258. The present protocol can be combined with immunocytochemistry as demonstrated for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). All steps of the procedure, including preparation and labelling of the cRNA probes, pretreatment of tissue, hybridization and visualization of the labelled transcripts, are described in detail.

Title: Cortical neurons arise in symmetric and asymmetric division zones and migrate through specific phases.
Journal: Nature neuroscience
Publication Date: Feb, 2004
Abstract:
Precise patterns of cell division and migration are crucial to transform the neuroepithelium of the embryonic forebrain into the adult cerebral cortex. Using time-lapse imaging of clonal cells in rat cortex over several generations, we show here that neurons are generated in two proliferative zones by distinct patterns of division. Neurons arise directly from radial glial cells in the ventricular zone (VZ) and indirectly from intermediate progenitor cells in the subventricular zone (SVZ). Furthermore, newborn neurons do not migrate directly to the cortex; instead, most exhibit four distinct phases of migration, including a phase of retrograde movement toward the ventricle before migration to the cortical plate. These findings provide a comprehensive and new view of the dynamics of cortical neurogenesis and migration.

Title: A role for the roof plate and its resident TGFbeta-related proteins in neuronal patterning in the dorsal spinal cord.
Journal: Cell
Publication Date: Oct, 1997
Abstract:
Distinct neuronal cell types are generated at characteristic times and positions in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. We provide evidence that the identity and pattern of generation of dorsal neurons depend initially on BMP-mediated signals that derive from the epidermal ectoderm and induce dorsal midline cells of the roof plate. Roof plate cells provide a secondary source of TGFbeta-related signals that are required for the generation of distinct classes of dorsal interneurons. These inductive interactions involve both qualitative and quantitative differences in signaling by TGFbeta-related factors and temporal changes in the response of neural progenitor cells.

Title: A CBP integrator complex mediates transcriptional activation and AP-1 inhibition by nuclear receptors.
Journal: Cell
Publication Date: May, 1996
Abstract:
Nuclear receptors regulate gene expression by direct activation of target genes and inhibition of AP-1. Here we report that, unexpectedly, activation by nuclear receptors requires the actions of CREB-binding protein (CBP) and that inhibition of AP-1 activity is the apparent result of competition for limiting amounts of CBP/p300 in cells. Utilizing distinct domains, CBP directly interacts with the ligand-binding domain of multiple nuclear receptors and with the p160 nuclear receptor coactivators, which upon cloning have proven to be variants of the SRC-1 protein. Because CBP represents a common factor, required in addition to distinct coactivators for function of nuclear receptors, CREB, and AP-1, we suggest that CBP/p300 serves as an integrator of multiple signal transduction pathways within the nucleus.

SMART (a Simple Modular Architecture Research Tool) allows the identification and annotation of genetically mobile domains and the analysis of domain architectures (http://SMART.embl-heidelberg.de ). More than 400 domain families found in signalling, extra-cellular and chromatin-associated proteins are detectable. These domains are extensively annotated with respect to phyletic distributions, functional class, tertiary structures and functionally important residues. Each domain found in a non-redundant protein database as well as search parameters and taxonomic information are stored in a relational database system. User interfaces to this database allow searches for proteins containing specific combinations of domains in defined taxa.

Title: Improved prediction of signal peptides: SignalP 3.0.
Journal: Journal of molecular biology
Publication Date: Jul, 2004
Abstract:
We describe improvements of the currently most popular method for prediction of classically secreted proteins, SignalP. SignalP consists of two different predictors based on neural network and hidden Markov model algorithms, where both components have been updated. Motivated by the idea that the cleavage site position and the amino acid composition of the signal peptide are correlated, new features have been included as input to the neural network. This addition, combined with a thorough error-correction of a new data set, have improved the performance of the predictor significantly over SignalP version 2. In version 3, correctness of the cleavage site predictions has increased notably for all three organism groups, eukaryotes, Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. The accuracy of cleavage site prediction has increased in the range 6-17% over the previous version, whereas the signal peptide discrimination improvement is mainly due to the elimination of false-positive predictions, as well as the introduction of a new discrimination score for the neural network. The new method has been benchmarked against other available methods. Predictions can be made at the publicly available web server

Title: Drosophila enhancer of Zeste/ESC complexes have a histone H3 methyltransferase activity that marks chromosomal Polycomb sites.
Journal: Cell
Publication Date: Oct, 2002
Abstract:
Enhancer of Zeste is a Polycomb Group protein essential for the establishment and maintenance of repression of homeotic and other genes. In the early embryo it is found in a complex that includes ESC and is recruited to Polycomb Response Elements. We show that this complex contains a methyltransferase activity that methylates lysine 9 and lysine 27 of histone H3, but the activity is lost when the E(Z) SET domain is mutated. The lysine 9 position is trimethylated and this mark is closely associated with Polycomb binding sites on polytene chromosomes but is also found in centric heterochromatin, chromosome 4, and telomeric sites. Histone H3 methylated in vitro by the E(Z)/ESC complex binds specifically to Polycomb protein.

However, the full potential of this technique has not been realized due to limitations imposed by the components available for use in the system. These limitations include unwieldy plasmid vectors, incomplete or poorly designed two-hybrid libraries, and host strains that result in the selection of large numbers of false positives. We have used a novel multienzyme approach to generate a set of highly representative genomic libraries from S. cerevisiae. In addition, a unique host strain was created that contains three easily assayed reporter genes, each under the control of a different inducible promoter. This host strain is extremely sensitive to weak interactions and eliminates nearly all false positives using simple plate assays. Improved vectors were also constructed that simplify the construction of the gene fusions necessary for the two-hybrid system. Our analysis indicates that the libraries and host strain provide significant improvements in both the number of interacting clones identified and the efficiency of two-hybrid selections.

Title: A transcriptional partner for MAD proteins in TGF-beta signalling.
Journal: Nature
Publication Date: Oct, 1996
Abstract:
The transforming-growth-factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily is critical for establishing mesoderm during early embryogenesis in Xenopus. The transcriptional activation of Mix.2, an immediate-early response gene specific to activin-like members of the TGF-beta superfamily, is associated with the rapid appearance of a site-specific DNA-binding activity that recognizes a fifty-base-pair regulatory element known as ARE in the Mix.2 promoter. Cloning of the site-specific DNA-binding component of this activity revealed it to be a new winged-helix transcription factor and a direct target for signalling by the TGF-beta superfamily. XMAD2, a recently identified TGF-beta signal transducer, forms a complex with the transcription factor in an activin-dependent fashion to generate an activated ARE-binding complex. A model is proposed to explain how TGF-beta superfamily signals might regulate the expression of specific genes in the early embryo.

Title: A new mathematical model for relative quantification in real-time RT-PCR.
Journal: Nucleic acids research
Publication Date: May, 2001
Abstract:
Use of the real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify cDNA products reverse transcribed from mRNA is on the way to becoming a routine tool in molecular biology to study low abundance gene expression. Real-time PCR is easy to perform, provides the necessary accuracy and produces reliable as well as rapid quantification results. But accurate quantification of nucleic acids requires a reproducible methodology and an adequate mathematical model for data analysis. This study enters into the particular topics of the relative quantification in real-time RT-PCR of a target gene transcript in comparison to a reference gene transcript. Therefore, a new mathematical model is presented. The relative expression ratio is calculated only from the real-time PCR efficiencies and the crossing point deviation of an unknown sample versus a control. This model needs no calibration curve. Control levels were included in the model to standardise each reaction run with respect to RNA integrity, sample loading and inter-PCR variations. High accuracy and reproducibility (<2.5% variation) were reached in LightCycler PCR using the established mathematical model.

Title: XTcf-3 transcription factor mediates beta-catenin-induced axis formation in Xenopus embryos.
Journal: Cell
Publication Date: Aug, 1996
Abstract:
XTcf-3 is a maternally expressed Xenopus homolog of the mammalian HMG box factors Tcf-1 and Lef-1. The N-terminus of XTcf-3 binds to beta-catenin. Microinjection of XTcf-3 mRNA in embryos results in nuclear translocation of beta-catenin. The beta-catenin-XTcf-3 complex activates transcription in a transient reporter gene assay, while XTcf-3 by itself is silent. N-terminal deletion of XTcf-3 (delta N) abrogates the interaction with beta-catenin, as well as the consequent transcription activation. This dominant-negative delta N mutant suppresses the induction of axis duplication by microinjected beta-catenin. It also suppresses endogenous axis specification upon injection into the dorsal blastomeres of a 4-cell-stage embryo. We propose that signaling by beta-catenin involves complex formation with XTcf-3, followed by nuclear translocation and activation of specific XTcf-3 target genes.

Title: A mammalian helix-loop-helix factor structurally related to the product of Drosophila proneural gene atonal is a positive transcriptional regulator expressed in the developing nervous system.
Journal: The Journal of biological chemistry
Publication Date: Apr, 1995
Abstract:
We report the molecular characterization of a mouse basic helix-loop-helix factor, designated MATH-1, structurally related to the product of the Drosophila proneural gene atonal. MATH-1 mRNA is first detected in the cranial ganglions and the dorsal part of the central nervous system on embryonic day 9.5 (E9.5). From E10.5 onward, prominent expression of MATH-1 continues in the dorsal part of the central nervous system but becomes restricted to the external granular layer of the cerebellum by E18 and is undetectable in the adult nervous system. MATH-1 activates E box-dependent transcription in collaboration with E47, but the activity is completely antagonized by the negative regulator of neurogenesis HES-1. These results suggest that MATH-1 may be a target of HES-1 and play a role in the differentiation of subsets of neural cells by activating E box-dependent transcription.

Title: A re-examination of proximodistal patterning during vertebrate limb development.
Journal: Nature
Publication Date: Aug, 2002
Abstract:
The 'progress zone' model provides a framework for understanding progressive development of the vertebrate limb. This model holds that undifferentiated cells in a zone of fixed size at the distal tip of the limb bud (the progress zone) undergo a progressive change in positional information such that their specification is altered from more proximal to more distal fates. This positional change is thought to be driven by an internal clock that is kept active as long as the cells remain in the progress zone. However, owing to cell division, the most proximal of these cells are continually pushed outside the confines of the zone. As they exit, clock function ceases and cells become fixed with the positional value last attained while within the zone. In contrast to this model, our data suggest that the various limb segments are 'specified' early in limb development as distinct domains, with subsequent development involving expansion of these progenitor populations before differentiation. We also find, however, that the distal limb mesenchyme becomes progressively 'determined', that is, irreversibly fixed, to a progressively limited range of potential proximodistal fates.

Title: Crystal structures of a complexed and peptide-free membrane protein-binding domain: molecular basis of peptide recognition by PDZ.
Journal: Cell
Publication Date: Jun, 1996
Abstract:
Modular PDZ domains, found in many cell junction-associated proteins, mediate the clustering of membrane ion channels by binding to their C-terminus. The X-ray crystallographic structures of the third PDZ domain from the synaptic protein PSD-95 in complex with and in the absence of its peptide ligand have been determined at 1.8 angstroms and 2.3 angstroms resolution, respectively. The structures reveal that a four-residue C-terminal stretch (X-Thr/Ser-X-Val-COO(-)) engages the PDZ domain through antiparallel main chain interactions with a beta sheet of the domain. Recognition of the terminal carboxylate group of the peptide is conferred by a cradle of main chain amides provided by a Gly-Leu-Gly-Phe loop as well as by an arginine side chain. Specific side chain interactions and a prominent hydrophobic pocket explain the selective recognition of the C-terminal consensus sequence.

Title: The release of cytochrome c from mitochondria: a primary site for Bcl-2 regulation of apoptosis.
Journal: Science (New York, N.Y.)
Publication Date: Feb, 1997
Abstract:
In a cell-free apoptosis system, mitochondria spontaneously released cytochrome c, which activated DEVD-specific caspases, leading to fodrin cleavage and apoptotic nuclear morphology. Bcl-2 acted in situ on mitochondria to prevent the release of cytochrome c and thus caspase activation. During apoptosis in intact cells, cytochrome c translocation was similarly blocked by Bcl-2 but not by a caspase inhibitor, zVAD-fmk. In vitro, exogenous cytochrome c bypassed the inhibitory effect of Bcl-2. Cytochrome c release was unaccompanied by changes in mitochondrial membrane potential. Thus, Bcl-2 acts to inhibit cytochrome c translocation, thereby blocking caspase activation and the apoptotic process.

Title: An initial blueprint for myogenic differentiation.
Journal: Genes & development
Publication Date: Mar, 2005
Abstract:
We have combined genome-wide transcription factor binding and expression profiling to assemble a regulatory network controlling the myogenic differentiation program in mammalian cells. We identified a cadre of overlapping and distinct targets of the key myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs)--MyoD and myogenin--and Myocyte Enhancer Factor 2 (MEF2). We discovered that MRFs and MEF2 regulate a remarkably extensive array of transcription factor genes that propagate and amplify the signals initiated by MRFs. We found that MRFs play an unexpectedly wide-ranging role in directing the assembly and usage of the neuromuscular junction. Interestingly, these factors also prepare myoblasts to respond to diverse types of stress. Computational analyses identified novel combinations of factors that, depending on the differentiation state, might collaborate with MRFs. Our studies suggest unanticipated biological insights into muscle development and highlight new directions for further studies of genes involved in muscle repair and responses to stress and damage.

Title: Dickkopf-1 is a member of a new family of secreted proteins and functions in head induction.
Journal: Nature
Publication Date: Jan, 1998
Abstract:
The Spemann organizer in amphibian embryos is a tissue with potent head-inducing activity, the molecular nature of which is unresolved. Here we describe dickkopf-1 (dkk-1), which encodes Dkk-1, a secreted inducer of Spemann's organizer in Xenopus and a member of a new protein family. Injections of mRNA and antibody indicate that dkk-1 is sufficient and necessary to cause head induction. dkk-1 s a potent antagonist of Wnt signalling, suggesting that dkk genes encode a family of secreted Wnt inhibitors.

Title: PAX2 is expressed in multiple spinal cord interneurons, including a population of EN1+ interneurons that require PAX6 for their development.
Journal: Development (Cambridge, England)
Publication Date: Nov, 1997
Abstract:
Members of the PAX family of transcription factors are candidates for controlling cell identity in the spinal cord. We have morphologically analyzed cells that express one of these transcription factors, PAX2, demonstrating multiple interneuron cell types express PAX2. Two ventral populations of PAX2-expressing interneurons in the spinal cord are marked by coexpression of the transcription factors, EN1 and EVX1. Interestingly, the expression domains of PAX2, EN1 and EVX1 in postmitotic neurons correlate closely with those of Pax6 and Pax7 in the ventricular zone, implicating these patterning genes in the regulation of PAX2, EN1 and EVX1. We show that one of these patterning genes, Pax6, is required for the correct specification of ventral PAX2+ interneurons that coexpress EN1. These results demonstrate that the early activity of patterning genes in the ventricular zone determines interneuron identity in the spinal cord.

Title: Rho GTPases control polarity, protrusion, and adhesion during cell movement.
Journal: The Journal of cell biology
Publication Date: Mar, 1999
Abstract:
Cell movement is essential during embryogenesis to establish tissue patterns and to drive morphogenetic pathways and in the adult for tissue repair and to direct cells to sites of infection. Animal cells move by crawling and the driving force is derived primarily from the coordinated assembly and disassembly of actin filaments. The small GTPases, Rho, Rac, and Cdc42, regulate the organization of actin filaments and we have analyzed their contributions to the movement of primary embryo fibroblasts in an in vitro wound healing assay. Rac is essential for the protrusion of lamellipodia and for forward movement. Cdc42 is required to maintain cell polarity, which includes the localization of lamellipodial activity to the leading edge and the reorientation of the Golgi apparatus in the direction of movement. Rho is required to maintain cell adhesion during movement, but stress fibers and focal adhesions are not required. Finally, Ras regulates focal adhesion and stress fiber turnover and this is essential for cell movement. We conclude that the signal transduction pathways controlled by the four small GTPases, Rho, Rac, Cdc42, and Ras, cooperate to promote cell movement.

Title: Conservation in hedgehog signaling: induction of a chicken patched homolog by Sonic hedgehog in the developing limb.
Journal: Development (Cambridge, England)
Publication Date: Apr, 1996
Abstract:
Hedgehog genes have been implicated in inductive signaling during development in a variety of organisms. A key element of the hedgehog signaling system is encoded by the gene patched. In Drosophila hedgehog regulates gene expression by antagonizing the action of patched. In addition, patched is itself a transcriptional target of hedgehog signaling. We have isolated a chicken patched homolog and find it to be strongly expressed adjacent to all tissues where members of the hedgehog family are expressed. As in Drosophila, ectopic expression of Sonic hedgehog leads to ectopic induction of chicken Patched. Based on this regulatory conservation, vertebrate Patched is likely to be directly downstream of Sonic hedgehog signaling. An important role of Sonic hedgehog is the regulation of anterior/posterior pattern in the developing limb bud. Since Patched is directly downstream of the hedgehog signal, the extent of high level Patched expression provides a measure of the distance that Sonic hedgehog diffuses and directly acts. On this basis, we find that Sonic hedgehog directly acts as a signal over only the posterior third of the limb bud. During limb patterning, secondary signals are secreted in both the mesoderm (e.g. Bone Morphogenetic Protein-2) and apical ectodermal ridge (e.g. Fibroblast Growth Factor-4) in response to Sonic hedgehog. Thus knowing which is the direct target tissue is essential for unraveling the molecular patterning of the limb. The expression of Patched provides a strong indication that the mesoderm and not the ectoderm is the direct target of Sonic hedgehog signaling in the limb bud. Finally we demonstrate that induction of Patched requires Sonic hedgehog but, unlike Bone Morphogenetic Protein-2 and Hox genes, does not require Fibroblast Growth Factor as a co-inducer. It is therefore a more direct target of Sonic hedgehog than previously reported patterning genes.

Title: WNT signals control FGF-dependent limb initiation and AER induction in the chick embryo.
Journal: Cell
Publication Date: Mar, 2001
Abstract:
A regulatory loop between the fibroblast growth factors FGF-8 and FGF-10 plays a key role in limb initiation and AER induction in vertebrate embryos. Here, we show that three WNT factors signaling through beta-catenin act as key regulators of the FGF-8/FGF-10 loop. The Wnt-2b gene is expressed in the intermediate mesoderm and the lateral plate mesoderm in the presumptive chick forelimb region. Cells expressing Wnt-2b are able to induce Fgf-10 and generate an extra limb when implanted into the flank. In the presumptive hindlimb region, another Wnt gene, Wnt-8c, controls Fgf-10 expression, and is also capable of inducing ectopic limb formation in the flank. Finally, we also show that the induction of Fgf-8 in the limb ectoderm by FGF-10 is mediated by the induction of Wnt-3a. Thus, three WNT signals mediated by beta-catenin control both limb initiation and AER induction in the vertebrate embryo.

Title: Cell survival promoted by the Ras-MAPK signaling pathway by transcription-dependent and -independent mechanisms.
Journal: Science (New York, N.Y.)
Publication Date: Nov, 1999
Abstract:
A mechanism by which the Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway mediates growth factor-dependent cell survival was characterized. The MAPK-activated kinases, the Rsks, catalyzed the phosphorylation of the pro-apoptotic protein BAD at serine 112 both in vitro and in vivo. The Rsk-induced phosphorylation of BAD at serine 112 suppressed BAD-mediated apoptosis in neurons. Rsks also are known to phosphorylate the transcription factor CREB (cAMP response element-binding protein) at serine 133. Activated CREB promoted cell survival, and inhibition of CREB phosphorylation at serine 133 triggered apoptosis. These findings suggest that the MAPK signaling pathway promotes cell survival by a dual mechanism comprising the posttranslational modification and inactivation of a component of the cell death machinery and the increased transcription of pro-survival genes.

Title: Evidence that tristetraprolin binds to AU-rich elements and promotes the deadenylation and destabilization of tumor necrosis factor alpha mRNA.
Journal: Molecular and cellular biology
Publication Date: Jun, 1999
Abstract:
Mice deficient in tristetraprolin (TTP), the prototype of a family of CCCH zinc finger proteins, develop an inflammatory syndrome mediated by excess tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha). Macrophages derived from these mice oversecrete TNF-alpha, by a mechanism that involves stabilization of TNF-alpha mRNA, and TTP can bind directly to the AU-rich element (ARE) in TNF-alpha mRNA (E. Carballo, W. S. Lai, and P. J. Blackshear, Science 281:1001-1005, 1998). We show here that TTP binding to the TNF-alpha ARE is dependent upon the integrity of both zinc fingers, since mutation of a single cysteine residue in either zinc finger to arginine severely attenuated the binding of TTP to the TNF-alpha ARE. In intact cells, TTP at low expression levels promoted a decrease in size of the TNF-alpha mRNA as well as a decrease in its amount; at higher expression levels, the shift to a smaller TNF-alpha mRNA size persisted, while the accumulation of this smaller species increased. RNase H experiments indicated that the shift to a smaller size was due to TTP-promoted deadenylation of TNF-alpha mRNA. This CCCH protein is likely to be important in the deadenylation and degradation of TNF-alpha mRNA and perhaps other ARE-containing mRNAs, both in normal physiology and in certain pathological conditions.

Title: Hypolipidemic drugs, polyunsaturated fatty acids, and eicosanoids are ligands for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors alpha and delta.
Journal: Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America
Publication Date: Apr, 1997
Abstract:
Fatty acids (FAs) and their derivatives are essential cellular metabolites whose concentrations must be closely regulated. This implies that regulatory circuits exist which can sense changes in FA levels. Indeed, the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) regulates lipid homeostasis and is transcriptionally activated by a variety of lipid-like compounds. It remains unclear as to how these structurally diverse compounds can activate a single receptor. We have developed a novel conformation-based assay that screens activators for their ability to bind to PPARalpha/delta and induce DNA binding. We show here that specific FAs, eicosanoids, and hypolipidemic drugs are ligands for PPARalpha or PPARdelta. Because altered FA levels are associated with obesity, atherosclerosis, hypertension, and diabetes, PPARs may serve as molecular sensors that are central to the development and treatment of these metabolic disorders.

Title: A somitic compartment of tendon progenitors.
Journal: Cell
Publication Date: Apr, 2003
Abstract:
We demonstrate that the tendons associated with the axial skeleton derive from a heretofore unappreciated, fourth compartment of the somites. Scleraxis (Scx), a bHLH transcription factor, marks this somitic tendon progenitor population at its inception, and is continuously expressed through differentiation into the mature tendons. Two earlier-formed somitic compartments, the sclerotome and myotome, interact to establish this fourth Scx-positive compartment. The tendon progenitors are induced at the sclerotome's edge, at the expense of skeletogenic Pax1 positive cells and in response to FGF signaling in the adjacent myotome. The tendon primordia thus form in a location abutting the two tissues that the mature tendons must ultimately connect. Tendon progenitor formation may reveal a general mechanism for the specification of other somitic subcompartments.
