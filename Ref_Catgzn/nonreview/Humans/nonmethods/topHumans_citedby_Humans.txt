Title: Single-step method of RNA isolation by acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction.
Journal: Analytical biochemistry
Publication Date: Apr, 1987
Abstract:
A new method of total RNA isolation by a single extraction with an acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform mixture is described. The method provides a pure preparation of undegraded RNA in high yield and can be completed within 4 h. It is particularly useful for processing large numbers of samples and for isolation of RNA from minute quantities of cells or tissue samples.

Title: Duplexes of 21-nucleotide RNAs mediate RNA interference in cultured mammalian cells.
Journal: Nature
Publication Date: May, 2001
Abstract:
RNA interference (RNAi) is the process of sequence-specific, post-transcriptional gene silencing in animals and plants, initiated by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) that is homologous in sequence to the silenced gene. The mediators of sequence-specific messenger RNA degradation are 21- and 22-nucleotide small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) generated by ribonuclease III cleavage from longer dsRNAs. Here we show that 21-nucleotide siRNA duplexes specifically suppress expression of endogenous and heterologous genes in different mammalian cell lines, including human embryonic kidney (293) and HeLa cells. Therefore, 21-nucleotide siRNA duplexes provide a new tool for studying gene function in mammalian cells and may eventually be used as gene-specific therapeutics.

Title: A system for stable expression of short interfering RNAs in mammalian cells.
Journal: Science (New York, N.Y.)
Publication Date: Apr, 2002
Abstract:
Mammalian genetic approaches to study gene function have been hampered by the lack of tools to generate stable loss-of-function phenotypes efficiently. We report here a new vector system, named pSUPER, which directs the synthesis of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) in mammalian cells. We show that siRNA expression mediated by this vector causes efficient and specific down-regulation of gene expression, resulting in functional inactivation of the targeted genes. Stable expression of siRNAs using this vector mediates persistent suppression of gene expression, allowing the analysis of loss-of-function phenotypes that develop over longer periods of time. Therefore, the pSUPER vector constitutes a new and powerful system to analyze gene function in a variety of mammalian cell types.

Title: Identification of prokaryotic and eukaryotic signal peptides and prediction of their cleavage sites.
Journal: Protein engineering
Publication Date: Jan, 1997
Abstract:
We have developed a new method for the identification of signal peptides and their cleavage sites based on neural networks trained on separate sets of prokaryotic and eukaryotic sequence. The method performs significantly better than previous prediction schemes and can easily be applied on genome-wide data sets. Discrimination between cleaved signal peptides and uncleaved N-terminal signal-anchor sequences is also possible, though with lower precision. Predictions can be made on a publicly available WWW server.

Title: Initial assessment of human gene diversity and expression patterns based upon 83 million nucleotides of cDNA sequence.
Journal: Nature
Publication Date: Sep, 1995
Abstract:
In an effort to identify new genes and analyse their expression patterns, 174,472 partial complementary DNA sequences (expressed sequence tags (ESTs)), totalling more than 52 million nucleotides of human DNA sequence, have been generated from 300 cDNA libraries constructed from 37 distinct organs and tissues. These ESTs have been combined with an additional 118,406 ESTs from the database dbEST, for a total of 83 million nucleotides, and treated as a shotgun sequence assembly project. The assembly process yielded 29,599 distinct tentative human consensus (THC) sequences and 58,384 non-overlapping ESTs. Of these 87,983 distinct sequences, 10,214 further characterize previously known genes based on statistically significant similarity to sequences in the available databases; the remainder identify previously unknown genes. Thirty tissues were sampled by over 1,000 ESTs each; only eight genes were matched by ESTs from all 30 tissues, and 227 genes were represented in 20 or more of the tissues sampled with more than 1,000 ESTs. Approximately 40% of identified human genes appear to be associated with basic energy metabolism, cell structure, homeostasis and cell division, 22% with RNA and protein synthesis and processing, and 12% with cell signalling and communication.

Title: An STS-based map of the human genome.
Journal: Science (New York, N.Y.)
Publication Date: Dec, 1995
Abstract:
A physical map has been constructed of the human genome containing 15,086 sequence-tagged sites (STSs), with an average spacing of 199 kilobases. The project involved assembly of a radiation hybrid map of the human genome containing 6193 loci and incorporated a genetic linkage map of the human genome containing 5264 loci. This information was combined with the results of STS-content screening of 10,850 loci against a yeast artificial chromosome library to produce an integrated map, anchored by the radiation hybrid and genetic maps. The map provides radiation hybrid coverage of 99 percent and physical coverage of 94 percent of the human genome. The map also represents an early step in an international project to generate a transcript map of the human genome, with more than 3235 expressed sequences localized. The STSs in the map provide a scaffold for initiating large-scale sequencing of the human genome.

Title: A signature motif in transcriptional co-activators mediates binding to nuclear receptors.
Journal: Nature
Publication Date: Jun, 1997
Abstract:
The binding of lipophilic hormones, retinoids and vitamins to members of the nuclear-receptor superfamily modifies the DNA-binding and transcriptional properties of these receptors, resulting in the activation or repression of target genes. Ligand binding induces conformational changes in nuclear receptors and promotes their association with a diverse group of nuclear proteins, including SRC-1/p160, TIF-2/GRIP-1 and CBP/p300 which function as co-activators of transcription, and RIP-140, TIF-1 and TRIP-1/SUG-1 whose functions are unclear. Here we report that a short sequence motif LXXLL (where L is leucine and X is any amino acid) present in RIP-140, SRC-1 and CBP is necessary and sufficient to mediate the binding of these proteins to liganded nuclear receptors. We show that the ability of SRC-1 to bind the oestrogen receptor and enhance its transcriptional activity is dependent upon the integrity of the LXXLL motifs and on key hydrophobic residues in a conserved helix (helix 12) of the oestrogen receptor that are required for its ligand-induced activation function. We propose that the LXXLL motif is a signature sequence that facilitates the interaction of different proteins with nuclear receptors, and is thus a defining feature of a new family of nuclear proteins.

Title: Cytochrome c and dATP-dependent formation of Apaf-1/caspase-9 complex initiates an apoptotic protease cascade.
Journal: Cell
Publication Date: Nov, 1997
Abstract:
We report here the purification of the third protein factor, Apaf-3, that participates in caspase-3 activation in vitro. Apaf-3 was identified as a member of the caspase family, caspase-9. Caspase-9 and Apaf-1 bind to each other via their respective NH2-terminal CED-3 homologous domains in the presence of cytochrome c and dATP, an event that leads to caspase-9 activation. Activated caspase-9 in turn cleaves and activates caspase-3. Depletion of caspase-9 from S-100 extracts diminished caspase-3 activation. Mutation of the active site of caspase-9 attenuated the activation of caspase-3 and cellular apoptotic response in vivo, indicating that caspase-9 is the most upstream member of the apoptotic protease cascade that is triggered by cytochrome c and dATP.

Title: Predicting coiled coils from protein sequences.
Journal: Science (New York, N.Y.)
Publication Date: May, 1991
Abstract:
The probability that a residue in a protein is part of a coiled-coil structure was assessed by comparison of its flanking sequences with sequences of known coiled-coil proteins. This method was used to delineate coiled-coil domains in otherwise globular proteins, such as the leucine zipper domains in transcriptional regulators, and to predict regions of discontinuity within coiled-coil structures, such as the hinge region in myosin. More than 200 proteins that probably have coiled-coil domains were identified in GenBank, including alpha- and beta-tubulins, flagellins, G protein beta subunits, some bacterial transfer RNA synthetases, and members of the heat shock protein (Hsp70) family.

Title: IPS-1, an adaptor triggering RIG-I- and Mda5-mediated type I interferon induction.
Journal: Nature immunology
Publication Date: Oct, 2005
Abstract:
Type I interferons are central mediators for antiviral responses. Using high-throughput functional screening of interferon inducers, we have identified here a molecule we call interferon-beta promoter stimulator 1 (IPS-1). Overexpression of IPS-1 induced type I interferon and interferon-inducible genes through activation of IRF3, IRF7 and NF-kappaB transcription factors. TBK1 and IKKi protein kinases were required for the IPS-1-mediated interferon induction. IPS-1 contained an N-terminal CARD-like structure that mediated interaction with the CARD of RIG-I and Mda5, which are cytoplasmic RNA helicases that sense viral infection. 'Knockdown' of IPS-1 by small interfering RNA blocked interferon induction by virus infection. Thus, IPS-1 is an adaptor involved in RIG-I- and Mda5-mediated antiviral immune responses.

Title: SMART, a simple modular architecture research tool: identification of signaling domains.
Journal: Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America
Publication Date: May, 1998
Abstract:
Accurate multiple alignments of 86 domains that occur in signaling proteins have been constructed and used to provide a Web-based tool (SMART: simple modular architecture research tool) that allows rapid identification and annotation of signaling domain sequences. The majority of signaling proteins are multidomain in character with a considerable variety of domain combinations known. Comparison with established databases showed that 25% of our domain set could not be deduced from SwissProt and 41% could not be annotated by Pfam. SMART is able to determine the modular architectures of single sequences or genomes; application to the entire yeast genome revealed that at least 6.7% of its genes contain one or more signaling domains, approximately 350 greater than previously annotated. The process of constructing SMART predicted (i) novel domain homologues in unexpected locations such as band 4.1-homologous domains in focal adhesion kinases; (ii) previously unknown domain families, including a citron-homology domain; (iii) putative functions of domain families after identification of additional family members, for example, a ubiquitin-binding role for ubiquitin-associated domains (UBA); (iv) cellular roles for proteins, such predicted DEATH domains in netrin receptors further implicating these molecules in axonal guidance; (v) signaling domains in known disease genes such as SPRY domains in both marenostrin/pyrin and Midline 1; (vi) domains in unexpected phylogenetic contexts such as diacylglycerol kinase homologues in yeast and bacteria; and (vii) likely protein misclassifications exemplified by a predicted pleckstrin homology domain in a Candida albicans protein, previously described as an integrin.

Title: Prediction of complete gene structures in human genomic DNA.
Journal: Journal of molecular biology
Publication Date: Apr, 1997
Abstract:
We introduce a general probabilistic model of the gene structure of human genomic sequences which incorporates descriptions of the basic transcriptional, translational and splicing signals, as well as length distributions and compositional features of exons, introns and intergenic regions. Distinct sets of model parameters are derived to account for the many substantial differences in gene density and structure observed in distinct C + G compositional regions of the human genome. In addition, new models of the donor and acceptor splice signals are described which capture potentially important dependencies between signal positions. The model is applied to the problem of gene identification in a computer program, GENSCAN, which identifies complete exon/intron structures of genes in genomic DNA. Novel features of the program include the capacity to predict multiple genes in a sequence, to deal with partial as well as complete genes, and to predict consistent sets of genes occurring on either or both DNA strands. GENSCAN is shown to have substantially higher accuracy than existing methods when tested on standardized sets of human and vertebrate genes, with 75 to 80% of exons identified exactly. The program is also capable of indicating fairly accurately the reliability of each predicted exon. Consistently high levels of accuracy are observed for sequences of differing C + G content and for distinct groups of vertebrates.

Title: Recognition of unique carboxyl-terminal motifs by distinct PDZ domains.
Journal: Science (New York, N.Y.)
Publication Date: Jan, 1997
Abstract:
The oriented peptide library technique was used to investigate the peptide-binding specificities of nine PDZ domains. Each PDZ domain selected peptides with hydrophobic residues at the carboxyl terminus. Individual PDZ domains selected unique optimal motifs defined primarily by the carboxyl terminal three to seven residues of the peptides. One family of PDZ domains, including those of the Discs Large protein, selected peptides with the consensus motif Glu-(Ser/Thr)-Xxx-(Val/Ile) (where Xxx represents any amino acid) at the carboxyl terminus. In contrast, another family of PDZ domains, including those of LIN-2, p55, and Tiam-1, selected peptides with hydrophobic or aromatic side chains at the carboxyl terminal three residues. On the basis of crystal structures of the PSD-95-3 PDZ domain, the specificities observed with the peptide library can be rationalized.

Title: A comprehensive genetic map of the human genome based on 5,264 microsatellites.
Journal: Nature
Publication Date: Mar, 1996
Abstract:
The great increase in successful linkage studies in a number of higher eukaryotes during recent years has essentially resulted from major improvements in reference genetic linkage maps, which at present consist of short tandem repeat polymorphisms of simple sequences or microsatellites. We report here the last version of the Généthon human linkage map. This map consists of 5,264 short tandem (AC/TG)n repeat polymorphisms with a mean heterozygosity of 70%. The map spans a sex-averaged genetic distance of 3,699 cM and comprises 2,335 positions, of which 2,032 could be ordered with an odds ratio of at least 1,000:1 against alternative orders. The average interval size is 1.6 cM; 59% of the map is covered by intervals of 2 cM at most and 1% remains in intervals above 10 cM.

Title: Improved tools for biological sequence comparison.
Journal: Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America
Publication Date: Apr, 1988
Abstract:
We have developed three computer programs for comparisons of protein and DNA sequences. They can be used to search sequence data bases, evaluate similarity scores, and identify periodic structures based on local sequence similarity. The FASTA program is a more sensitive derivative of the FASTP program, which can be used to search protein or DNA sequence data bases and can compare a protein sequence to a DNA sequence data base by translating the DNA data base as it is searched. FASTA includes an additional step in the calculation of the initial pairwise similarity score that allows multiple regions of similarity to be joined to increase the score of related sequences. The RDF2 program can be used to evaluate the significance of similarity scores using a shuffling method that preserves local sequence composition. The LFASTA program can display all the regions of local similarity between two sequences with scores greater than a threshold, using the same scoring parameters and a similar alignment algorithm; these local similarities can be displayed as a "graphic matrix" plot or as individual alignments. In addition, these programs have been generalized to allow comparison of DNA or protein sequences based on a variety of alternative scoring matrices.

Title: ATM and ATR substrate analysis reveals extensive protein networks responsive to DNA damage.
Journal: Science (New York, N.Y.)
Publication Date: May, 2007
Abstract:
Cellular responses to DNA damage are mediated by a number of protein kinases, including ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) and ATR (ATM and Rad3-related). The outlines of the signal transduction portion of this pathway are known, but little is known about the physiological scope of the DNA damage response (DDR). We performed a large-scale proteomic analysis of proteins phosphorylated in response to DNA damage on consensus sites recognized by ATM and ATR and identified more than 900 regulated phosphorylation sites encompassing over 700 proteins. Functional analysis of a subset of this data set indicated that this list is highly enriched for proteins involved in the DDR. This set of proteins is highly interconnected, and we identified a large number of protein modules and networks not previously linked to the DDR. This database paints a much broader landscape for the DDR than was previously appreciated and opens new avenues of investigation into the responses to DNA damage in mammals.

Title: Cardif is an adaptor protein in the RIG-I antiviral pathway and is targeted by hepatitis C virus.
Journal: Nature
Publication Date: Oct, 2005
Abstract:
Antiviral immunity against a pathogen is mounted upon recognition by the host of virally associated structures. One of these viral 'signatures', double-stranded (ds) RNA, is a replication product of most viruses within infected cells and is sensed by Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) and the recently identified cytosolic RNA helicases RIG-I (retinoic acid inducible gene I, also known as Ddx58) and Mda5 (melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5, also known as Ifih1 or Helicard). Both helicases detect dsRNA, and through their protein-interacting CARD domains, relay an undefined signal resulting in the activation of the transcription factors interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and NF-kappaB. Here we describe Cardif, a new CARD-containing adaptor protein that interacts with RIG-I and recruits IKKalpha, IKKbeta and IKKvarepsilon kinases by means of its C-terminal region, leading to the activation of NF-kappaB and IRF3. Overexpression of Cardif results in interferon-beta and NF-kappaB promoter activation, and knockdown of Cardif by short interfering RNA inhibits RIG-I-dependent antiviral responses. Cardif is targeted and inactivated by NS3-4A, a serine protease from hepatitis C virus known to block interferon-beta production. Cardif thus functions as an adaptor, linking the cytoplasmic dsRNA receptor RIG-I to the initiation of antiviral programmes.

Title: Nuclear receptor coactivator ACTR is a novel histone acetyltransferase and forms a multimeric activation complex with P/CAF and CBP/p300.
Journal: Cell
Publication Date: Aug, 1997
Abstract:
We report here the identification of a novel cofactor, ACTR, that directly binds nuclear receptors and stimulates their transcriptional activities in a hormone-dependent fashion. ACTR also recruits two other nuclear factors, CBP and P/CAF, and thus plays a central role in creating a multisubunit coactivator complex. In addition, and unexpectedly, we show that purified ACTR is a potent histone acetyltransferase and appears to define a distinct evolutionary branch to this recently described family. Thus, hormonal activation by nuclear receptors involves the mutual recruitment of at least three classes of histone acetyltransferases that may act cooperatively as an enzymatic unit to reverse the effects of histone deacetylase shown to be part of the nuclear receptor corepressor complex.

Title: Identification and characterization of MAVS, a mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein that activates NF-kappaB and IRF 3.
Journal: Cell
Publication Date: Sep, 2005
Abstract:
Viral infection triggers host innate immune responses through activation of the transcription factors NF-kappaB and IRF 3, which coordinately regulate the expression of type-I interferons such as interferon-beta (IFN-beta). Herein, we report the identification of a novel protein termed MAVS (mitochondrial antiviral signaling), which mediates the activation of NF-kappaB and IRF 3 in response to viral infection. Silencing of MAVS expression through RNA interference abolishes the activation of NF-kappaB and IRF 3 by viruses, thereby permitting viral replication. Conversely, overexpression of MAVS induces the expression of IFN-beta through activation of NF-kappaB and IRF 3, thus boosting antiviral immunity. Epistasis experiments show that MAVS is required for the phosphorylation of IRF 3 and IkappaB and functions downstream of RIG-I, an intracellular receptor for viral RNA. MAVS contains an N-terminal CARD-like domain and a C-terminal transmembrane domain, both of which are essential for MAVS signaling. The transmembrane domain targets MAVS to the mitochondria, implicating a new role of mitochondria in innate immunity.

Title: The small GTP-binding proteins Rac1 and Cdc42 regulate the activity of the JNK/SAPK signaling pathway.
Journal: Cell
Publication Date: Jun, 1995
Abstract:
c-Jun amino-terminal kinases (JNKs) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are closely related; however, they are independently regulated by a variety of environmental stimuli. Although molecules linking growth factor receptors to MAPKs have been recently identified, little is known about pathways controlling JNK activation. Here, we show that in COS-7 cells, activated Ras effectively stimulates MAPK but poorly induces JNK activity. In contrast, mutationally activated Rac1 and Cdc42 GTPases potently activate JNK without affecting MAPK, and oncogenic guanine nucleotide exchange factors for these Rho-like proteins selectively stimulate JNK activity. Furthermore, expression of inhibitory molecules for Rho-related GTPases and dominant negative mutants of Rac1 and Cdc42 block JNK activation by oncogenic exchange factors or after induction by inflammatory cytokines and growth factors. Taken together, these findings strongly support a critical role for Rac1 and Cdc42 in controlling the JNK signaling pathway.

Title: A technique for radiolabeling DNA restriction endonuclease fragments to high specific activity.
Journal: Analytical biochemistry
Publication Date: Jul, 1983
Abstract:
A technique for conveniently radiolabeling DNA restriction endonuclease fragments to high specific activity is described. DNA fragments are purified from agarose gels directly by ethanol precipitation and are then denatured and labeled with the large fragment of DNA polymerase I, using random oligonucleotides as primers. Over 70% of the precursor triphosphate is routinely incorporated into complementary DNA, and specific activities of over 10(9) dpm/microgram of DNA can be obtained using relatively small amounts of precursor. These "oligolabeled" DNA fragments serve as efficient probes in filter hybridization experiments.

Title: Stress-dependent regulation of FOXO transcription factors by the SIRT1 deacetylase.
Journal: Science (New York, N.Y.)
Publication Date: Mar, 2004
Abstract:
The Sir2 deacetylase modulates organismal life-span in various species. However, the molecular mechanisms by which Sir2 increases longevity are largely unknown. We show that in mammalian cells, the Sir2 homolog SIRT1 appears to control the cellular response to stress by regulating the FOXO family of Forkhead transcription factors, a family of proteins that function as sensors of the insulin signaling pathway and as regulators of organismal longevity. SIRT1 and the FOXO transcription factor FOXO3 formed a complex in cells in response to oxidative stress, and SIRT1 deacetylated FOXO3 in vitro and within cells. SIRT1 had a dual effect on FOXO3 function: SIRT1 increased FOXO3's ability to induce cell cycle arrest and resistance to oxidative stress but inhibited FOXO3's ability to induce cell death. Thus, one way in which members of the Sir2 family of proteins may increase organismal longevity is by tipping FOXO-dependent responses away from apoptosis and toward stress resistance.

Title: Identification of c-MYC as a target of the APC pathway.
Journal: Science (New York, N.Y.)
Publication Date: Sep, 1998
Abstract:
The adenomatous polyposis coli gene (APC) is a tumor suppressor gene that is inactivated in most colorectal cancers. Mutations of APC cause aberrant accumulation of beta-catenin, which then binds T cell factor-4 (Tcf-4), causing increased transcriptional activation of unknown genes. Here, the c-MYC oncogene is identified as a target gene in this signaling pathway. Expression of c-MYC was shown to be repressed by wild-type APC and activated by beta-catenin, and these effects were mediated through Tcf-4 binding sites in the c-MYC promoter. These results provide a molecular framework for understanding the previously enigmatic overexpression of c-MYC in colorectal cancers.

Title: FADD, a novel death domain-containing protein, interacts with the death domain of Fas and initiates apoptosis.
Journal: Cell
Publication Date: May, 1995
Abstract:
Using the cytoplasmic domain of Fas in the yeast two-hybrid system, we have identified a novel interacting protein, FADD, which binds Fas and Fas-FD5, a mutant of Fas possessing enhanced killing activity, but not the functionally inactive mutants Fas-LPR and Fas-FD8. FADD contains a death domain homologous to the death domains of Fas and TNFR-1. A point mutation in FADD, analogous to the lpr mutation of Fas, abolishes its ability to bind Fas, suggesting a death domain to death domain interaction. Overexpression of FADD in MCF7 and BJAB cells induces apoptosis, which, like Fas-induced apoptosis, is blocked by CrmA, a specific inhibitor of the interleukin-1 beta-converting enzyme. These findings suggest that FADD may play an important role in the proximal signal transduction of Fas.

Title: Clustering of Shaker-type K+ channels by interaction with a family of membrane-associated guanylate kinases.
Journal: Nature
Publication Date: Nov, 1995
Abstract:
ANCHORING of ion channels at specific subcellular sites is critical for neuronal signalling, but the mechanisms underlying channel localization and clustering are largely unknown (reviewed in ref. 1). Voltage-gated K+ channels are concentrated in various neuronal domains, including presynaptic terminals, nodes of Ranvier and dendrites, where they regulate local membrane excitability. Here we present functional and biochemical evidence that cell-surface clustering of Shaker-subfamily K+ channels is mediated by the PSD-95 family of membrane-associated putative guanylate kinases, as a result of direct binding of the carboxy-terminal cytoplasmic tails to the K+ channel subunits to two PDZ (also known as GLGF or DHR) domains in the PSD-95 protein. The ability of PDZ domains to function as independent modules for protein-protein interaction, and their presence in other junction-associated molecules (such as ZO-1 (ref. 3) and syntrophin), suggest that PDZ-domain-containing polypeptides may be widely involved in the organization of proteins at sites of membrane specialization.

Title: Involvement of MACH, a novel MORT1/FADD-interacting protease, in Fas/APO-1- and TNF receptor-induced cell death.
Journal: Cell
Publication Date: Jun, 1996
Abstract:
Fas/APO-1 and p55 tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor (p55-R) activate cellular mechanisms that result in cell death. Upon activation of these receptors, Fas/APO-1 binds a protein called MORT1 (or FADD) and p55-R binds a protein called TRADD. MORT1 and TRADD can also bind to each other. We have cloned a novel protein, MACH, that binds to MORT1. This protein exists in multiple isoforms, some of which contain a region that has proteolytic activity and shows marked sequence homology to proteases of the ICE/CED-3 family. Cellular expression of the proteolytic MACH isoforms results in cell death. Expression of MACH isoforms that contain an incomplete ICE/CED-3 region provides effective protection against the cytotoxicity induced by Fas/APO-1 or p55-R triggering. These findings suggest that MACH is the most upstream enzymatic component in the Fas/APO-1- and p55-R-induced cell death signaling cascades.

Title: Proteomic characterization of the human centrosome by protein correlation profiling.
Journal: Nature
Publication Date: Dec, 2003
Abstract:
The centrosome is the major microtubule-organizing centre of animal cells and through its influence on the cytoskeleton is involved in cell shape, polarity and motility. It also has a crucial function in cell division because it determines the poles of the mitotic spindle that segregates duplicated chromosomes between dividing cells. Despite the importance of this organelle to cell biology and more than 100 years of study, many aspects of its function remain enigmatic and its structure and composition are still largely unknown. We performed a mass-spectrometry-based proteomic analysis of human centrosomes in the interphase of the cell cycle by quantitatively profiling hundreds of proteins across several centrifugation fractions. True centrosomal proteins were revealed by both correlation with already known centrosomal proteins and in vivo localization. We identified and validated 23 novel components and identified 41 likely candidates as well as the vast majority of the known centrosomal proteins in a large background of nonspecific proteins. Protein correlation profiling permits the analysis of any multiprotein complex that can be enriched by fractionation but not purified to homogeneity.

Title: PML is critical for ND10 formation and recruits the PML-interacting protein daxx to this nuclear structure when modified by SUMO-1.
Journal: The Journal of cell biology
Publication Date: Oct, 1999
Abstract:
Nuclear domain 10 (ND10), also referred to as nuclear bodies, are discrete interchromosomal accumulations of several proteins including promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) and Sp100. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of ND10 assembly by identifying proteins that are essential for this process using cells lines that lack individual ND10-associated proteins. We identified the adapter protein Daxx and BML, the RecQ helicase missing in Bloom syndrome, as new ND10-associated proteins. PML, but not BLM or Sp100, was found to be responsible for the proper localization of all other ND10-associated proteins since they are dispersed in PML-/- cells. Introducing PML into this cell line by transient expression or fusion with PML-producing cells recruited ND10-associated proteins into de novo formed ND10 attesting to PMLs essential nature in ND10 formation. In the absence of PML, Daxx is highly enriched in condensed chromatin. Its recruitment to ND10 from condensed chromatin requires a small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO-1) modification of PML and reflects the interaction between the COOH-terminal domain of Daxx and PML. The segregation of Daxx from condensed chromatin in the absence of PML to ND10 by increased accumulation of SUMO-1-modified PML suggests the presence of a variable equilibrium between these two nuclear sites. Our findings identify the basic requirements for ND10 formation and suggest a dynamic mechanism for protein recruitment to these nuclear domains controlled by the SUMO-1 modification state of PML.

Title: The tyrosine kinase negative regulator c-Cbl as a RING-type, E2-dependent ubiquitin-protein ligase.
Journal: Science (New York, N.Y.)
Publication Date: Oct, 1999
Abstract:
Ubiquitination of receptor protein-tyrosine kinases (RPTKs) terminates signaling by marking active receptors for degradation. c-Cbl, an adapter protein for RPTKs, positively regulates RPTK ubiquitination in a manner dependent on its variant SRC homology 2 (SH2) and RING finger domains. Ubiquitin-protein ligases (or E3s) are the components of ubiquitination pathways that recognize target substrates and promote their ligation to ubiquitin. The c-Cbl protein acted as an E3 that can recognize tyrosine-phosphorylated substrates, such as the activated platelet-derived growth factor receptor, through its SH2 domain and that recruits and allosterically activates an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme through its RING domain. These results reveal an SH2-containing protein that functions as a ubiquitin-protein ligase and thus provide a distinct mechanism for substrate targeting in the ubiquitin system.

Title: WAF1, a potential mediator of p53 tumor suppression.
Journal: Cell
Publication Date: Nov, 1993
Abstract:
The ability of p53 to activate transcription from specific sequences suggests that genes induced by p53 may mediate its biological role as a tumor suppressor. Using a subtractive hybridization approach, we identified a gene, named WAF1, whose induction was associated with wild-type but not mutant p53 gene expression in a human brain tumor cell line. The WAF1 gene was localized to chromosome 6p21.2, and its sequence, structure, and activation by p53 was conserved in rodents. Introduction of WAF1 cDNA suppressed the growth of human brain, lung, and colon tumor cells in culture. Using a yeast enhancer trap, a p53-binding site was identified 2.4 kb upstream of WAF1 coding sequences. The WAF1 promoter, including this p53-binding site, conferred p53-dependent inducibility upon a heterologous reporter gene. These studies define a gene whose expression is directly induced by p53 and that could be an important mediator of p53-dependent tumor growth suppression.

Title: Identification and characterization of an IkappaB kinase.
Journal: Cell
Publication Date: Jul, 1997
Abstract:
Activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB by tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin-1 (IL-1) requires the NF-kappaB-inducing kinase (NIK). In a yeast two-hybrid screen for NIK-interacting proteins, we have identified a protein kinase previously known as CHUK. Overexpression of CHUK activates a NF-kappaB-dependent reporter gene. A catalytically inactive mutant of CHUK is a dominant-negative inhibitor of TNF-, IL-1-, TRAF-, and NIK-induced NF-kappaB activation. CHUK associates with the NF-kappaB inhibitory protein, IkappaB-alpha, in mammalian cells. CHUK specifically phosphorylates IkappaB-alpha on both serine 32 and serine 36, modifications that are required for targeted degradation of IkappaB-alpha via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. This phosphorylation of IkappaB-alpha is greatly enhanced by NIK costimulation. Thus, CHUK is a NIK-activated IkappaB-alpha kinase that links TNF- and IL-1-induced kinase cascades to NF-kappaB activation.

Title: 5'-Triphosphate RNA is the ligand for RIG-I.
Journal: Science (New York, N.Y.)
Publication Date: Nov, 2006
Abstract:
The structural basis for the distinction of viral RNA from abundant self RNA in the cytoplasm of virally infected cells is largely unknown. We demonstrated that the 5'-triphosphate end of RNA generated by viral polymerases is responsible for retinoic acid-inducible protein I (RIG-I)-mediated detection of RNA molecules. Detection of 5'-triphosphate RNA is abrogated by capping of the 5'-triphosphate end or by nucleoside modification of RNA, both occurring during posttranscriptional RNA processing in eukaryotes. Genomic RNA prepared from a negative-strand RNA virus and RNA prepared from virus-infected cells (but not from noninfected cells) triggered a potent interferon-alpha response in a phosphatase-sensitive manner. 5'-triphosphate RNA directly binds to RIG-I. Thus, uncapped 5'-triphosphate RNA (now termed 3pRNA) present in viruses known to be recognized by RIG-I, but absent in viruses known to be detected by MDA-5 such as the picornaviruses, serves as the molecular signature for the detection of viral infection by RIG-I.

Title: Isolation of genes from complex sources of mammalian genomic DNA using exon amplification.
Journal: Nature genetics
Publication Date: Jan, 1994
Abstract:
Modifications to exon amplification have been instituted that increase its speed, efficiency and reliability. Exons were isolated from target human or mouse genomic DNA sources ranging from 30 kilobases (kb) to 3 megabases (Mb) in complexity. The efficiency was dependent upon the amount of input DNA, and ranged from isolation of an exon for every 20 kb to an exon for every 80 kb of target genomic DNA. In these studies, several novel genes and a smaller number of genes isolated previously that reside on human chromosome 9 have been identified. These results indicate that exon amplification is presently adaptable to large scale isolation of exons from complex sources of genomic DNA.

Title: Mdm2 promotes the rapid degradation of p53.
Journal: Nature
Publication Date: May, 1997
Abstract:
The p53 tumour-suppressor protein exerts antiproliferative effects, including growth arrest and apoptosis, in response to various types of stress. The activity of p53 is abrogated by mutations that occur frequently in tumours, as well as by several viral and cellular proteins. The Mdm2 oncoprotein is a potent inhibitor of p53. Mdm2 binds the transcriptional activation domain of p53 and blocks its ability to regulate target genes and to exert antiproliferative effects. On the other hand, p53 activates the expression of the mdm2 gene in an autoregulatory feedback loop. The interval between p53 activation and consequent Mdm2 accumulation defines a time window during which p53 exerts its effects. We now report that Mdm2 also promotes the rapid degradation of p53 under conditions in which p53 is otherwise stabilized. This effect of Mdm2 requires binding of p53; moreover, a small domain of p53, encompassing the Mdm2-binding site, confers Mdm2-dependent detstabilization upon heterologous proteins. Raised amounts of Mdm2 strongly repress mutant p53 accumulation in tumour-derived cells. During recovery from DNA damage, maximal Mdm2 induction coincides with rapid p53 loss. We propose that the Mdm2-promoted degradation of p53 provides a new mechanism to ensure effective termination of the p53 signal.

Title: IKK-1 and IKK-2: cytokine-activated IkappaB kinases essential for NF-kappaB activation.
Journal: Science (New York, N.Y.)
Publication Date: Oct, 1997
Abstract:
Activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) is controlled by sequential phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and degradation of its inhibitory subunit IkappaB. A large multiprotein complex, the IkappaB kinase (IKK) signalsome, was purified from HeLa cells and found to contain a cytokine-inducible IkappaB kinase activity that phosphorylates IkappaB-alpha and IkappaB-beta. Two components of the IKK signalsome, IKK-1 and IKK-2, were identified as closely related protein serine kinases containing leucine zipper and helix-loop-helix protein interaction motifs. Mutant versions of IKK-2 had pronounced effects on RelA nuclear translocation and NF-kappaB-dependent reporter activity, consistent with a critical role for the IKK kinases in the NF-kappaB signaling pathway.

Title: TRADD-TRAF2 and TRADD-FADD interactions define two distinct TNF receptor 1 signal transduction pathways.
Journal: Cell
Publication Date: Jan, 1996
Abstract:
Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) can induce apoptosis and activate NF-kappa B through signaling cascades emanating from TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1). TRADD is a TNFR1-associated signal transducer that is involved in activating both pathways. Here we show that TRADD directly interacts with TRAF2 and FADD, signal transducers that activate NF-kappa B and induce apoptosis, respectively. A TRAF2 mutant lacking its N-terminal RING finger domain is a dominant-negative inhibitor of TNF-mediated NF-kappa B activation, but does not affect TNF-induced apoptosis. Conversely, a FADD mutant lacking its N-terminal 79 amino acids is a dominant-negative inhibitor of TNF-induced apoptosis, but does not inhibit NF-kappa B activation. Thus, these two TNFR1-TRADD signaling cascades appear to bifurcate at TRADD.

Title: A new bacteriophage P1-derived vector for the propagation of large human DNA fragments.
Journal: Nature genetics
Publication Date: Jan, 1994
Abstract:
We have designed a P1 vector (pCYPAC-1) for the introduction of recombinant DNA into E. coli using electroporation procedures. The new cloning system, P1-derived artificial chromosomes (PACs), was used to establish an initial 15,000 clone library with an average insert size of 130-150 kilobase pairs (kb). No chimaerism has been observed in 34 clones, by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Similarly, no insert instability has been observed after extended culturing, for 20 clones. We conclude that the PAC cloning system will be useful in the mapping and detailed analysis of complex genomes.

Title: Targeting of HIF-alpha to the von Hippel-Lindau ubiquitylation complex by O2-regulated prolyl hydroxylation.
Journal: Science (New York, N.Y.)
Publication Date: Apr, 2001
Abstract:
Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) is a transcriptional complex that plays a central role in the regulation of gene expression by oxygen. In oxygenated and iron replete cells, HIF-alpha subunits are rapidly destroyed by a mechanism that involves ubiquitylation by the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (pVHL) E3 ligase complex. This process is suppressed by hypoxia and iron chelation, allowing transcriptional activation. Here we show that the interaction between human pVHL and a specific domain of the HIF-1alpha subunit is regulated through hydroxylation of a proline residue (HIF-1alpha P564) by an enzyme we have termed HIF-alpha prolyl-hydroxylase (HIF-PH). An absolute requirement for dioxygen as a cosubstrate and iron as cofactor suggests that HIF-PH functions directly as a cellular oxygen sensor.

Title: Akt promotes cell survival by phosphorylating and inhibiting a Forkhead transcription factor.
Journal: Cell
Publication Date: Mar, 1999
Abstract:
Survival factors can suppress apoptosis in a transcription-independent manner by activating the serine/ threonine kinase Akt, which then phosphorylates and inactivates components of the apoptotic machinery, including BAD and Caspase 9. In this study, we demonstrate that Akt also regulates the activity of FKHRL1, a member of the Forkhead family of transcription factors. In the presence of survival factors, Akt phosphorylates FKHRL1, leading to FKHRL1's association with 14-3-3 proteins and FKHRL1's retention in the cytoplasm. Survival factor withdrawal leads to FKHRL1 dephosphorylation, nuclear translocation, and target gene activation. Within the nucleus, FKHRL1 triggers apoptosis most likely by inducing the expression of genes that are critical for cell death, such as the Fas ligand gene.

Title: Selective activation of the JNK signaling cascade and c-Jun transcriptional activity by the small GTPases Rac and Cdc42Hs.
Journal: Cell
Publication Date: Jun, 1995
Abstract:
The Rho subfamily of GTPases is involved in control of cell morphology in mammals and yeast. The mammalian Rac and Cdc42 proteins control formation of lamellipodia and filopodia, respectively. These proteins also activate MAP kinase (MAPK) cascades that regulate gene expression. Constitutively activated forms of Rac and Cdc42Hs are efficient activators of a cascade leading to JNK and p38/Mpk2 activation. RhoA did not exhibit this activity, and none of the proteins activated the ERK subgroup of MAPKs. JNK, but not ERK, activation was also observed in response to Dbl, an oncoprotein that acts as a nucleotide exchange factor for Cdc42Hs. Results with dominant interfering alleles place Rac1 as an intermediate between Ha-Ras and MEKK in the signaling cascade leading from growth factor receptors and v-Src to JNK activation. JNK and p38 activation are likely to contribute to the biological effects of Rac, Cdc42Hs, and Dbl on cell growth and proliferation.

Title: FLICE, a novel FADD-homologous ICE/CED-3-like protease, is recruited to the CD95 (Fas/APO-1) death--inducing signaling complex.
Journal: Cell
Publication Date: Jun, 1996
Abstract:
To identify CAP3 and CAP4, components of the CD95 (Fas/APO-1) death-inducing signaling complex, we utilized nano-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry, a recently developed technique to sequence femtomole quantities of polyacrylamide gel-separated proteins. Interestingly, CAP4 encodes a novel 55 kDa protein, designated FLICE, which has homology to both FADD and the ICE/CED-3 family of cysteine proteases. FLICE binds to the death effector domain of FADD and upon overexpression induces apoptosis that is blocked by the ICE family inhibitors, CrmA and z-VAD-fmk. CAP3 was identified as the FLICE prodomain which likely remains bound to the receptor after proteolytic activation. Taken together, this is unique biochemical evidence to link a death receptor physically to the proapoptotic proteases of the ICE/CED-3 family.

Title: HIFalpha targeted for VHL-mediated destruction by proline hydroxylation: implications for O2 sensing.
Journal: Science (New York, N.Y.)
Publication Date: Apr, 2001
Abstract:
HIF (hypoxia-inducible factor) is a transcription factor that plays a pivotal role in cellular adaptation to changes in oxygen availability. In the presence of oxygen, HIF is targeted for destruction by an E3 ubiquitin ligase containing the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein (pVHL). We found that human pVHL binds to a short HIF-derived peptide when a conserved proline residue at the core of this peptide is hydroxylated. Because proline hydroxylation requires molecular oxygen and Fe(2+), this protein modification may play a key role in mammalian oxygen sensing.

Title: AIB1, a steroid receptor coactivator amplified in breast and ovarian cancer.
Journal: Science (New York, N.Y.)
Publication Date: Aug, 1997
Abstract:
Members of the recently recognized SRC-1 family of transcriptional coactivators interact with steroid hormone receptors to enhance ligand-dependent transcription. AIB1, a member of the SRC-1 family, was cloned during a search on the long arm of chromosome 20 for genes whose expression and copy number were elevated in human breast cancers. AIB1 amplification and overexpression were observed in four of five estrogen receptor-positive breast and ovarian cancer cell lines. Subsequent evaluation of 105 unselected specimens of primary breast cancer found AIB1 amplification in approximately 10 percent and high expression in 64 percent of the primary tumors analyzed. AIB1 protein interacted with estrogen receptors in a ligand-dependent fashion, and transfection of AIB1 resulted in enhancement of estrogen-dependent transcription. These observations identify AIB1 as a nuclear receptor coactivator whose altered expression may contribute to development of steroid-dependent cancers.

Title: Independent human MAP-kinase signal transduction pathways defined by MEK and MKK isoforms.
Journal: Science (New York, N.Y.)
Publication Date: Feb, 1995
Abstract:
Mammalian mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases include extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK), c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 subgroups. These MAP kinase isoforms are activated by dual phosphorylation on threonine and tyrosine. Two human MAP kinase kinases (MKK3 and MKK4) were cloned that phosphorylate and activate p38 MAP kinase. These MKK isoforms did not activate the ERK subgroup of MAP kinases, but MKK4 did activate JNK. These data demonstrate that the activators of p38 (MKK3 and MKK4), JNK (MKK4), and ERK (MEK1 and MEK2) define independent MAP kinase signal transduction pathways.

Title: Activation of IKK by TNFalpha requires site-specific ubiquitination of RIP1 and polyubiquitin binding by NEMO.
Journal: Molecular cell
Publication Date: Apr, 2006
Abstract:
The receptor interacting protein kinase 1 (RIP1) is essential for the activation of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha). Here, we present evidence that TNFalpha induces the polyubiquitination of RIP1 at Lys-377 and that this polyubiquitination is required for the activation of IkappaB kinase (IKK) and NF-kappaB. A point mutation of RIP1 at Lys-377 (K377R) abolishes its polyubiquitination as well as its ability to restore IKK activation in a RIP1-deficient cell line. The K377R mutation of RIP1 also prevents the recruitment of TAK1 and IKK complexes to TNF receptor. Interestingly, polyubiquitinated RIP1 recruits IKK through the binding between the polyubiquitin chains and NEMO, a regulatory subunit of the IKK complex. Mutations of NEMO that disrupt its polyubiquitin binding also abolish IKK activation. These results reveal the biochemical mechanism underlying the essential signaling function of NEMO and provide direct evidence that signal-induced site-specific ubiquitination of RIP1 is required for IKK activation.

Title: The Rho family GTPases RhoA, Rac1, and CDC42Hs regulate transcriptional activation by SRF.
Journal: Cell
Publication Date: Jun, 1995
Abstract:
The c-fos serum response element (SRE) forms a ternary complex with the transcription factors SRF (serum response factor) and TCF (ternary complex factor). By itself, SRF can mediate transcriptional activation induced by serum, lysophosphatidic acid, or intracellular activation of heterotrimeric G proteins. Activated forms of the Rho family GTPases RhoA, Rac1, and CDC42Hs also activate transcription via SRF and act synergistically at the SRE with signals that activate TCF. Functional Rho is required for signaling to SRF by several stimuli, but not by activated CDC42Hs or Rac1. Activation of the SRF-linked signaling pathway does not correlate with activation of the MAP kinases ERK, SAPK/JNK, or MPK2/p38. Functional Rho is required for regulated activity of the c-fos promoter. These results establish SRF as a nuclear target of a novel Rho-mediated signaling pathway.

Title: Regulation of p53 stability by Mdm2.
Journal: Nature
Publication Date: May, 1997
Abstract:
The tumour-suppressor p53 is a short-lived protein that is maintained at low, often undetectable, levels in normal cells. Stabilization of the protein in response to an activating signal, such as DNA damage, results in a rapid rise in p53 levels and subsequent inhibition of cell growth. Tight regulation of p53 function is critical for normal cell growth and development, and one mechanism by which p53 function is controlled is through interaction with the Mdm2 protein. Mdm2 inhibits p53 cell-cycle arrest and apoptic functions and we show here that interaction with Mdm2 can also result in a large reduction in p53 protein levels through enhanced proteasome-dependent degradation. Endogenous levels of Mdm2 are sufficient to regulate p53 stability, and overexpression of Mdm2 can reduce the amount of endogenous p53. Because mdm2 is transcriptionally activated by p53, this degradative pathway may contribute to the maintenance of low p53 concentrations in normal cells. Furthermore, mechanisms regulating the Mdm2-induced degradation of p53 may play a role in controlling the extent and duration of the p53 response.
